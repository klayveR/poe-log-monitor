## [1.2.5] - 2018-11-21
### Added
- Functionality to parse the entire log from the beginning has been added
- Added timestamps to all current events, as a separate regex group that can be used. Useful for comparing timestamps when parsing the entire log.
- The following inputs have been added
    - `includedEvents` specifies the events that should be used. By default it includes all events specified in Events.json.
    - `chunkSize` determines the chunksize when parsing the entire log. 
    - `chunkInterval` specifies the interval at which the parser will chunk data. Can be delayed if slower parsing is accepted, in cases where it would otherwhise affect performance.
- The following events have been added
    - `parsingStarted` emits when the parsing of the file has started.
    - `parsingComplete` emits when the parsing of the file has completed. 

### Changes
- Wrapped regex-matching in a new function called `registerMatch`.

### Fixed
- Fixed some areas that had incorrectly formatted boss-arrays.

## [1.2.4] - 2018-07-10
### Added
- The following events have been added
    - `instanceServer` emits when the player joins a new instance server. This can be useful for determining whether a player enters an area instance the player previously entered, or a newly created one.
- Added `info` data for map areas

### Changes
- Normalized boss data for all areas

    - `areaJoin` emits when another player joins the area the player is in
    - `areaLeave` emits when another player leaves the area the player is in
- Added labyrinth trials and the Aspirants' plaza to the `labyrinth` areas

## [1.2.2] - 2018-05-29
### Added
- The object emitted by the `area` event now has an additional property `type`
- Vaal side areas and hideouts have been added to known areas
- Added [AREA.md](https://github.com/klayveR/poe-log-monitor/blob/master/AREA.md) for more detailed information about the `area` event

### Removed
- Areas of the `area` type have had the `map` property removed from the `info` object

## [1.2.1] - 2018-05-27
### Added

    - `trade` emits when the player accepts or cancels a trade
    
## [1.2.0] - 2018-05-27
### Added
- The following events have been added
    - `npcEncounter` emits when the player encounters a talking NPC in the wild
    - `masterEncounter` emits when the player encounters a master in an area
    >âš  `Output Dialogue To Game` must be activated in the game UI options for these two events to work
- The `area` event now emits additional area data (`info`) if data matching the area name is found in the `areas.json`. `info` is an array which can currently contain up to two objects holding area information for different variants of the area (take Lioneye's Watch for example, which has an area in Act 1 and Act 6).
- Added an example for the new `info` object which can be found in the `examples` folder

### Changes
- The `name` and `guild` properties of the `message` and `whisper` event are now stored in the `player` object
- The `area` property of the `area` event is now `name`

### Fixed

- Fixed the regular expression for the `remaining` event, it'll now also emit when there's more than 50 monsters in the area

    - `remaining` emits when the player uses the `/remaining` command in game
    
### Changes
- Eliminated the use of `undefined` in code
- Methods that simply renamed match groups and emitted them as a new object are now handled in a single method (events which require additional evaluation of the data are still in separate functions)
- Events as well as their corresponding regular expressions and functions/group names are now stored in `events.json`
