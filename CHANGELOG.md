The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.2.1] - 2018-05-27

## [1.2.0] - 2018-05-27
### Added
- The following events have been added
    - `npcEncounter` emits when the player encounters a talking NPC in the wild
    - `masterEncounter` emits when the player encounters a master in an area
    >âš  `Output Dialogue To Game` must be activated in the game UI options for these two events to work
- The `area` event now emits additional area data (`info`) if data matching the area name is found in the `areas.json`. `info` is an array which can currently contain up to two objects holding area information for different variants of the area (take Lioneye's Watch for example, which has an area in Act 1 and Act 6).
- Added an example for the new `info` object which can be found in the `examples` folder

### Changes
- The `name` and `guild` elements of the `message` and `whisper` event are now stored in the `player` object
- The `area` element of the `area` event is now `name`

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused the DND/AFK status to always be false

### Added

    - `remaining` emits when the player uses the `/remaining` command in game
    
### Changes

### Fixed
